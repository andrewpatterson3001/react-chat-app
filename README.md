I made a simple chat/list application to test what i know about React/Redux. Master is pure React and the redux branch is both React and Redux.

If you'd like to run this application:

1. clone and go into the repo
2. `npm install -g webpack` and `npm install -g nodemon`
3. run `npm install` and `npm run watch`
4. open the index.html in your browser
5. Enjoy!

**My reflections after a day working on this:**

-- JavaScript requires more configuration than I'm used to with Rails

-- Managing state with Redux may be overengineering in this case, but it wasn't that hard to set up the store. Reducers could get messy.

-- It's fast

**What I'd like to try next:**

-- ~~Add tests~~ and propTypes validations

-- Organize Reducers

-- Rails Backend

-- Host it
